# Predator-The-Malware

This is a Malware,that encrypts data of all the partitions created on your system including C drive and performs various stuffs like rotating your screen horribly, displaying Threatening Message via banner and in Audio format and put your all screen black with a text "You Have been Hacked" in the middle of the screen in Green font(for fun purposes i added this). shutdown system after these stuffs. At instance This a Basic Malware ( for educational purposes only !!)

If you do not have Backup of your File, don't ever try to use it in your real system, there is no possibilities to get your data back.
You can play with it, although it is Basic
